## 🚀 Quick Start (For the Eager!)

If you want to dive in immediately:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd "E:\Clients Work\kissan Ghar\Kissan Ghar Dashboard"

# 2. Install all dependencies
npm install
cd server && npm install && npm install multer uuid
cd ../client && npm install
cd ..

# 3. Setup PostgreSQL database
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE Kissan_ghar_automation;"
psql -U postgres -d Kissan_ghar_automation -f schema.sql

# 4. Configure database (if needed)
# Edit server/db.js with your PostgreSQL credentials

# 5. Run migrations and import data
cd server
npm run migrate
npm run import-data

# 6. Create .env file in server/ with N8N webhooks (see docs)

# 7. Start everything
cd ..
npm run dev

# 8. Open browser
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend: http://localhost:4000
```

**Detailed instructions:** See `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`

## ⚠️ Critical Things to Know Upfront

### 1. Missing Dependencies ⚠️
The `server/package.json` is missing `multer` and `uuid`. Install them:
```bash
cd server
npm install multer uuid
```

### 2. Database Configuration ⚠️
Database credentials are hardcoded in `server/db.js`:
- Host: localhost
- Port: 5000 (not the default 5432!)
- User: postgres
- Password: 3234
- Database: Kissan_ghar_automation

**Update these to match your PostgreSQL setup!**

### 3. N8N Required for Full Functionality ⚠️
Without N8N configured:
- Videos will stay in "pending" status
- No AI script/video/title/description generation
- No platform uploads

You can test the UI without N8N, but the complete workflow requires it.

### 4. Environment Variables Required ⚠️
Create `server/.env` with N8N webhook URLs and callback token.
See `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` for full details.

## 🎯 Key Features to Explore

### 1. Video Generation Workflow (The Core Feature!)

```
User Input → Script Generation → Script Approval → 
Video Generation → Video Approval → Title Generation → 
Title Approval → Tags Generation → Tags Approval → 
Description Generation → Description Approval → 
Platform Upload → Published!
```

This is a **multi-step workflow with AI integration at each stage**. Understanding this is critical.

**Where to start:** `client/src/pages/CreateVideo.tsx` and `server/routes/videos.js`

### 2. Real-Time Updates (SSE)

The dashboard uses **Server-Sent Events** for live updates. When AI generates a script or video, the frontend updates automatically without page refresh.

**Where to look:** `server/routes/sse.js` and `client/src/hooks/useSSE.ts`

### 3. Product Management

Complete CRUD system for products with multi-image upload support (up to 4 images per product).

**Where to look:** `client/src/pages/AddProduct.tsx` and `server/routes/products.js`

### 4. Analytics Dashboard

Real-time analytics showing:
- Total products
- Scripts generated
- Videos generated  
- Videos published
- Pending approvals

**Where to look:** `client/src/pages/Analytics.tsx` and `server/routes/analytics.js`
